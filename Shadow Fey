            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Shadow Fey resemble elves physically, with some striking differences. Their skin color tends toward alabaster white, ebon black, or subtle grays. A few have scitillating, shimmering skin. Many shadow few have horns, from subtle nubs to large and obvious protrusions, either satyr- or fiend-like depending on the chronicler.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Even to most shadow fey, their history is unknown, and differing stories about their origin abound. The most prevalent story recounts that the shadow fey were elves who made pacts with forces of darkness millennia ago, most likely during hte Sorceress's Revolt when a group of beleaguered elves turned to those powers out of desperation. The official history of the Shadow Courts assumes this version of events is true, and the Shadow Reckoning (SR) calendar begins at that time. Sarastra, the Queen of Night and Magic, is featured as both the diving patron and the founder of the shadow fey in this tale, a fact she is pleased to exploit when it suits her.

It is certain that there is some truth to this story. Both the records and the memories of ancient elves support this particular version of events as they are commonly recalled.

While the submission to dark magic is acknowledged, other tales deny this as the sole origin of the shadow fey. The Queen of Night and Magic existed long before the once-elven princess Sarastra came to rule the shadow fey, and stories of their exploits reach back centuries prior to the Sorceress's revolt. Indeed, many shadow fey seem more closely related to other fey races than to elves, despite the relatively short span of time since their supposed separation.

Mentions of alternate planes, chaos, and time magic - particularly in the environs of Zobeck and Castle Shadowcrag - contribute to the confusion. In the end, only the gods know the true origin of the shadow fey. Speculation is rampant but not often shared. As is commonly said in the Summer Court, it is unwise to argue with a goddess. Sarastra's accounting of events suffices for most individuals.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>The enigmatic shadow fey of the Shadow Realm dwell in ebon spires and moonlit keeps, encroaching on the mortal world in places where barriers between the planes are thin. They prowl the darkest recesses of the forest, hunting mortal prey. They dance in the darkly luminous halls of their shadow palaces, the lords and ladies of twilight. Their actions brim with contradictions and their motivations are shrouded in mystery. They seek to throw their observers off-guard, for anyone and everyone is a potential enemy.</p>
            <h4>SHADOW FEY NAMES</h4>
            <p>Naming conventions among the shadow fey are similar to those favored by elves, but their imagery is darker and more guarded. They favor themes of gloom and seclusion over sunshine and tinkling brooks.</p>
